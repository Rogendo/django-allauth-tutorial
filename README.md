# Django Allauth

### Pros:

Django Allauth is one of the most popular Django packages.
It supports over 50 authentication providers (e.g., GitHub, Twitter, Google).
Along with social auth, it also provides regular auth with username and password.
Django Allauth makes it easy to customize the forms used during the auth flow.
### Cons:

Despite the package’s popularity, the documentation is poorly structured and not meant for beginners.
There’s quite a bit of initial setup required to register an OAuth provider, which can be difficult for beginners.
There’s 4000+ issues on GitHub (as of writing).
Python Social Auth

### Pros:

Python Social Auth provides support for several Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, Webpy, Pyramid, and Tornado.
It supports almost 50 OAuth providers.
It supports the Django ORM and MongoEngine ODM.
It provides a storage interface to allow users to add more ORMs.
### Cons:

The documentation is a bit simpler, but it could still use some work with regard to the organization.
Again, there’s quite a bit of initial setup required to register an OAuth provider, which can be difficult for beginners.
There’s close to 125 open issues on GitHub (as of writing).
Both packages have their ups and downs. However, this tutorial focuses on Django Allauth as it’s much more popular and supports social auth and regular auth via username and password.
